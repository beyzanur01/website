  <p> Miss Kobayashi works very hard to make our cafe as historically accurate as possible! She's very passionate about maids and sleeping! </p>
  <p> Lady Tohru is our dragon chef and Miss Kobayashi's friend! Her cooking skills are excellent, and she can make any food that you want! She also deals with deliveries. She guarantees fast service 100% of the time. </p>
  <p> Kanna-chan is out little mascot! She's nine years old and very friendly. Feel free to drop by to say hi to her! </p>
  <p> Shouta is also our little mascot! You may see him around often. He's very shy, but if you approach him kindly and gently you shouldn't have a problem.</p>
  <p> Lucoa is one of our servers! Although she has some boundary issues, she lightens the atmosphere of the cafe! </p>
  <p> Fafnir is the guy who sells some books in the back. He's our friend, but we don't suggest bothering him. <i> <b> Do not call him a butler unless you want to be deleted off the universe.</i> </b> </p>
  <p> Makato's our most precious (...and only) customer! He's very sociable, especially if you chat about otaku stuff!</p>
